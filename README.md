## Hello, my name is Allen

Professionally, I am a senior software engineer with experience across the
entire software development lifecycle in many domains using a wide variety of
programming languages and technology stacks.

Personally, I am an extremely curious lifelong learner with a passion for
building cool or interesting (and sometimes useful) things.
When not busy working on other things, I can usually be found tinkering around
with my Emacs config. 

I started my career in video game development, particularly on the
server side of massively-multiplayer games, for companies such as
BioWare, Electronic Arts, Sony Computer Entertainment, and Midway.
This phase of my career really cemented my passion for building
high-performance, scalable, and secure distributed systems.

Most recently, I worked for Samba TV as a principle software engineer.
Samba TV is a technology and data company that specializes in television and
cross-platform audience measurement, analytics, and advertising solutions.
Its core business revolves around collecting and analyzing viewership data from
connected TVs and other devices to help media companies, advertisers, and
marketers make data-driven decisions about content performance, audience
engagement, and advertising effectiveness.

It was at Samba TV that I really began to see the value of containers.
This ultimately led me to blazing the trail for orchestrating these
containers at scale with Kubernetes in AWS. While we succeeded in operating
our services and other workloads in Kubernetes, the increase in complexity and
the baseline knowledge required made the developer experience difficult when
getting started.
As a developer myself, I could empathize.
As a platform engineer I could address the problem.

I prototyped our first internal developer platform, and refined it over three
generations to provide a platform offering developers golden paths with
guardrails in a self-service, multi-tenant, GitOps-managed Kubernetes cluster
fleet running both in AWS and our on-premise datacenter.

I still find platform engineering interesting and challenging, and the emering
AI capabilities have proven to be useful to me in the diagnosis of problems,
as well as human-in-the-loop remediation of them.

I have been building and learning with agents such as Claude Code and OpenCode,
as well as the latest madels appropriate to my work, typically Anthropic and
Open AI models. I have also been developing custom agents with various SDKs in
Python and TypeScript.
Most recently, I have been building local RAG systems to further enhance results
with hybrid lexical and semantic search.
